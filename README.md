# concretion

This is very much still in a state of flux and subject to radical change. It is also largely undocumented.

The most interesting parts are currently in the object system. (see [this](https://github.com/cadpnq/concretion/blob/master/packages/engine/mixins/GameObject.js) and [this](https://github.com/cadpnq/concretion/blob/master/engine/objects.js))

Engine development will no longer be happening in this repository. If you're interested you should be watching [MUDout](https://github.com/cadpnq/mudout) instead. At some point I will break off the engine from there and merge it back here.
